you can generate modules, service
same architecture module <- controllers <- service
pipes are just functions that transform types without changing the original data



create moduels with nest g module
install 2 prisma dependencies npm i -D prisma && npm i @prisma/client
then run 
npx prisma init

update models to schema.prisma
after that run; npx prisma migrate dev then npx prisma generate

in prisma module extends the prisma client to contain the logic to connect our app to db

now for validation you can use pipes but using pipes for every req.body field will result in excess code
so use custom-validation and custom-transform library

for above libs u have to tell app to use libs validation pipes not builtin validation pipes
 app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe);
 add above in main.ts

for jwt(hashing) work use argon2 but bcrypt can also be used

for authentication install a bunch of libraries:
